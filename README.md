# Practice

This is Jack Meng's coding practice repo. Most of the code here are just my solutions to online judges (e.g. Codeforces, Atcoder). However, I also upload my notes and other helpful resources into this repository as well.

## Content

* [`./Solves/`](./Solves/) - Contains all of my general programming solutions and notes **as of October 2024**. These are mostly for OJs like Codeforces, Atcoder, LeetCode, etc..

* [`./Old-Solves/`](./Old-Solves/) - Contains all of my solutions from my past (pre 2023 era).

* [`Resources.md`](./Resources.md) - Contains helpful resources that I have found to be extremely helpful.

* [`To_Learn.md`](./To_Learn.md) - Are just simple reminders of what I still need to work on.
