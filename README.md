# README

I put my solves here for online competitive programming contests/past contests.

This repo is sometimes inactive because I forgot to add on to, and plus school :/ can't do programming contests a lot. Still
AtCoded will be my favorite platform :)

Check [interesting.txt](./interesting.txt) for some resources and links to possibly helpful materials! :D <br>
^constantly being updated!

# Forked
The fork exoad/competitive-programming is a beta staging of the original competitive-programming meaning that I have to make sure 
every piece of code works before I publish to meng-jack/competitive-programming
