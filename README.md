# README

I put my solves here for online competitive programming contests/past contests.

This repo is sometimes inactive because I forgot to add on to, and plus school :/ can't do programming contests a lot. Still
AtCoded will be my favorite platform :)

Check [interesting.txt](./interesting.txt) for some resources and links to possibly helpful materials! :D <br>
^constantly being updated!

# Forked
The forked version exoad/competitive-programmiing is mainly for me to put everything there, while the original acts as 
the "final product." In the fork, I make sure everything I have written isn't false and all pieces of code runs correctly
(however runs correctly does not mean it would run on all platforms)

# Code Conduct
All code belongs to me otherwise if specified to the original author (e.g. Problem Setter). Otherwise if the owner is unknown, code ownership will placed under **my** 
alliance.
